        <h1><b>Ticket 006:</b> Redirection based on user agent</h1>
        <pre>I want to redirect visitor with specific user agent (*MSIE 8.0* for example) to a different page. It seems this is not possible
            with Cloudflare Page Rules. Is there any other way to achieve that using Cloudflare?</pre>
