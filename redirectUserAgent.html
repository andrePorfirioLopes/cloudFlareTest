        <h1><b>Ticket 006:</b> Redirection based on user agent</h1>
        <pre>I want to redirect visitor with specific user agent (*MSIE 8.0* for example) to a different page. It seems this is not possible
            with Cloudflare Page Rules. Is there any other way to achieve that using Cloudflare?</pre>

            Hello Customer,
            
            While it isn't possible to redirect a user agent conditionally via Page Rules, it is possible to do so via a conditional response script, which can be setup to react to an incoming request's URL, HTTP method, User Agent, IP Address, ASN or other device type.
            You can find a template example for a conditional response in our Developers article: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/conditional-response/

            Please let us know if you have any additional questions or issues.
            Best regards,
        </pre>
