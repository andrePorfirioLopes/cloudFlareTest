        <h1><b>Ticket 004:</b> Cloudflare Nameservers</h1>
        <pre>How are Cloudflare's nameservers different from the DNS provided by Google DNS or OpenDNS? Can I delegate to Cloudflare nameservers while still using my host's DNS?</pre>

            Hello Customer,
            The main differences between Cloudflare Nameservers and other DNS providers come down to Performance, Pricing, Redudancy and Security.
            Cloudflare regularly outperforms in response time, offers multiple pricing plans, increased redundancy with a global DNS service network and Anycast and multiple security features including firewall, DNSSEC, Access Control options and DDoS protection.
            More details and a comparisson with Google DNS specifically can be found on our website: https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/cloudflare-vs-google-dns/#comparison-table
            
            Regarding domain delegation, we currently support both delegating subdomains to third parties while keeping your domain managed through Cloudflare, as well as keeping your doman managed through a third party while delegating subdomains to cloudflare.
            To delegate subdomains to Cloudflare while still using keeping your root domain, you should use CNAME for partial setup: https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup
            If instead you're looking to migrate your domain to Cloudflare while keeping subdomains delegated to another provider, this is also possible via Subdomain delegation as per: https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/subdomains-outside-cloudflare/

            Please let us know if you have any additional queries or encounter any other issues.
            Best regards,
        </pre>

            Technically two questions, one regarding comparisson with other DNS providers and another regarding domain/subdomain delegation.
            Linked articles for subdomain delegation and CNAME:

            Client may require assistance with domain delegation - if so, should this be a separate ticket or do we keep it in this one?
