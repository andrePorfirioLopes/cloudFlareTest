        <h1><b>Ticket 002:</b> Why is my site coming from California?!</h1>
        <pre>I'm in London, but looking at your IPs it shows that you are serving my website from California. Can that be right? Why is
            that? I thought you were supposed to serve my website from some places close to me?</pre>

            Hello Customer,
            Please note that if your website is proxied through Cloudflare, then a lookup of your domain may return one of our IP addresses instead of your original address as this allows Cloudflare to optimize, cache, and protect all requests for your website.

            Cloudflare utilizes an Anycast Network so traffic will prioritize the nearest and best responding server, as detailed here: https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/
            You can also validate which Cloudflare Data Center your requests are routing through by addding /cdn-cgi/trace to the domain name, per example: example.com/cdn-cgi/trace , where the value in front of "colo=" should match the nearest international airport to your data center.
            
            Please let us know if you have any additional questions or issues.
            Best regards,
        </pre>
