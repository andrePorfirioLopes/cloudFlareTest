        <h1><b>Ticket 003:</b> Workers not applied</h1>
        <pre>I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website: it works in the debugger but doesn't work when I
            query the site. Why is that? Is there anything to activate or anything I could check?</pre>

            Hello Customer,

            Does the issue still occur if you perform a cacheless reload of the website or load in incognito mode/private browsing?
            Note that you can perform a cacheless reload on Google Chrome as follows:
            - Press F12 to load Chrome Dev Tools;
            - Right-click the refresh button to the left of the navigation bar;
            - Select Empty Cache and Hard Reload

            If the issue persists after a cacheless reload and in incognito mode/private browsing, please reply with the attached console output of your browser.
            To collect the output on Google Chrome, follow these steps:
            - Press F12 to load Chrome Dev Tools;
            - Select Console on the newly opened sidepanel;
            - Refresh the website;
            - Right-click anywhere on the Console output and select Save As
            - Save the new log file to your desktop or other directory
            - Attach the log file in your next reply to this ticket

            Please let us know if you have any additional questions or issues.
            Best regards,
        </pre>

            Lots of possible reason, most common is bad cache or blocking code from running in browser - as client mentions being able to run in sandbox/preview.
            If a cache clear doesn't solve it AND if running in Incognito doesn't solve it (likely eliminating interference from addons or script blockers), a look at the browser console logs should clear up why it's failing
