        <h1><b>Ticket 005:</b> Content not Being Cached</h1>
        <pre>After activating Cloudflare on my site, I am seeing that resources on my pages are not being cached:
            curl -svo /dev/null roskolniv.us
            * Rebuilt URL to: roskolniv.us/
            * Trying 104.16.27.128...
            * Connected to roskolniv.us (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
            > GET / HTTP/1.1
            > User-Agent: curl/7.40.0
            > Host: roskolniv.us

            { [3507 bytes data]
            * Connection #0 to host roskolniv.us left intact
            Why is Cloudflare's caching not working on my site?</pre>

            Hello Customer,
            
            As per your message, it seems like your origin server is telling Cloudflare not to cache:
                Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0, max-age=0

            Note that you can customize what should and should not be cached from your website by setting cache rules as per our article: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/customize-cache/

            Please let us know if you have any additional questions or issues.
            Best regards,
        </pre>

            The response itself specifically mentions no caching for cache control:
                Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0, max-age=0
            Customer either missed it or doesn't realize what it means, might need to provide further assistance with cache setup if customer has issues following article.
