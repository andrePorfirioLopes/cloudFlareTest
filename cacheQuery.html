        <h1><b>Ticket 005:</b> Content not Being Cached</h1>
        <pre>After activating Cloudflare on my site, I am seeing that resources on my pages are not being cached:
            curl -svo /dev/null roskolniv.us
            * Rebuilt URL to: roskolniv.us/
            * Trying 104.16.27.128...
            * Connected to roskolniv.us (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
            > GET / HTTP/1.1
            > User-Agent: curl/7.40.0
            > Host: roskolniv.us
            > Accept: */*
            >
            < HTTP/1.1 200 OK

            < X-Powered-By: Express
            < Server: cloudflare-nginx

            <
            { [3507 bytes data]
            * Connection #0 to host roskolniv.us left intact
            Why is Cloudflareâ€™s caching not working on my site?</pre>
